description "Wayland protocol for communicating application menu DBus objects"

`This description provides a high-level overview of the interplay between
the interfaces defined in this protocol. For details, see the protocol
specification.

The appmenu_manager allows a client to request the creation of an appmenu
object associated with an xdg_toplevel. The appmenu object allows a client to
notify the compositor of a DBus com.canonical.dbusmenu object associated with
itself.

Clients should request the creation of an appmenu object when they create a
DBus object for their application menu, and should release the object when they
destroy a DBus object for their application menu.

Clients should only own at most one appmenu object for each of their xdg_toplevel
objects. A protocol error will be raised if a client requests more than one appmenu
object for an xdg_toplevel.`
